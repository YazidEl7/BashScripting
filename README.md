SFTP (Secure FTP): (run it as SU) Lately I was working on some powershell projects and I needed an SFTP to use and I hadn't much time.
I thought why not to make a script that'll guide me to do a Quick setup of an SFTP server, Using CentOS 8.
my script is pretty basic and goes as far as my knowledge goes to this moment which is not much. I'd like anyone who want to contribute to it,
in order to optimize it and make it better. it's still ongoing, it needs to catch errors rather than continuing, like when the installation fails due to internet problems.
Outputing the errors and trying again the failed step. 
also maybe doing a cleanup or a check if it's the second time it's being run.
