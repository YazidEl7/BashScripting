- SFTP ( #Guided Quick SFTP Server Config# ): (run it as SU) Lately I was working on some powershell projects and I needed an SFTP to use and I hadn't much time.
I thought why not to make a script that'll guide me to do a Quick setup of an SFTP server, Using CentOS 8.
my script is pretty basic and goes as far as my knowledge goes to this moment which is not much. I'd like anyone who want to contribute to it or report issues for improvement purpose.
